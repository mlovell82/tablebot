This repository is for a project we created at Kent State University for the Human and Robotic Interaction course taught by Dr. Hoon-Jong Kim.
Tablebot is an autonomous robot that can be called by a user and asked to do a list of operations like:
  a. follow a user until asked to stop
  b. mingle around to a number of users and provide a service "like serving beverages"
  c. go back to it's original location
  d. provide items like tools to the user when requested and put them back
